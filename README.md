Most of us feel that these digital screens are basically a new friend.

The mobile phone screen is the main entrance for dialogue between people and mobile phones, and is also a graphical user interface for human-computer interaction.

The type of images used as wallpaper for our devices does tend to change quite a bit. Most people opt for wallpapers that are meaningful to them. From pictures with their kids/friends or with the resident pet, these are common wallpapers that you can find literally anywhere. On the other hand though, itâ€™s important to note that some people want to have images with certain locations from all over the world. They use the smartphone wallpaper as the means to disconnect from the day to day life, to reach new locations with their mind and remove stress.
